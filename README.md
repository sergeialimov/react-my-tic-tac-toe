This project based on [tutorial by reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
Unlike [the previous repository](https://github.com/sergeialimov/react-game-tic-tac-toe) this one was created without watching to the tutorial.
I took the original idea and tried to reproduce the app. During implementing I faced lots of basic issues, read the docs and was looking for solutions in the internet.
Additionally Linter check was added to the project. I added the air-bnb config with some additional rules. It forces me to improve structure of app, separate component between files and update a syntax.
After finish I've compared the results and made some updates.
